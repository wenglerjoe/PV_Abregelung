# PV_Abregelung
This repository contains all necessary code to analyse and interpret Energy-Loss due to constant reduction of PV-Production. It has been established during the work of the Workgroup "AG PV Abregelung" as part of VSE.

The Code in this repository is being run on Databricks and uses proprietary data from Pronovo. This data is not open-source so running the code cannot be reproduced. It can however be used to check whether the logic is correct and to verify that the calculations presented in the "Branchendokument" from the "AG PV Abregelung" are indeed correct.
